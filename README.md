In this project, we have developed a machine learning model to predict the profit of a company based on its R&D Spend, Administration Cost, and Marketing Spend. The dataset contains 50 companies' information about their R&D Spend, Administration Cost, Marketing Spend, and Profit. Our objective is to build a model that can accurately predict the profit of a company when its R&D Spend, Administration Cost, and Marketing Spend are given. We have implemented different regression models and evaluated their performance to choose the best model.

The implementation of this project involves the following steps:

1.Import necessary libraries: Import the required Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

2.Load the dataset: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

3.Explore the dataset: Explore the dataset to identify any missing values, outliers, or other data quality issues.

4.Preprocess the data: Split the dataset into training and test sets, normalize the data, and select the relevant features.

5.Train the models: Train different regression models, including linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic net regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.

6.Evaluate the models: Evaluate the performance of each model using various regression metrics, such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared score.

7.Compare the models: Compare the performance of each model and select the best-performing one.

8.Deploy the model: Deploy the selected model in a suitable environment, such as a web application or a mobile app.

9.Interpret the results: Interpret the results of the selected model and analyze the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable.
